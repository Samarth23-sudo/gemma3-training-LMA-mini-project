## 🌟 Key Features

### ✅ Official Google Implementation
- Uses the official `gemma_pytorch` repository
- All model architectures: Gemma 1, 2, and 3
- Supports 1B, 2B, 4B, 7B, 9B, 12B, 27B variants
- Production-ready, tested codebase

### ✅ Kaggle-Optimized
- **Memory Management**: Auto-adjusts for 16GB GPU limit
- **Checkpointing**: Emergency saves, resume from interruptions
- **Data Loading**: Handles 20GB+ corpus efficiently
- **Time Management**: Optimized for Kaggle's 30-hour limit

### ✅ Multilingual Ready
- **Custom Tokenizer**: Integrates your SentencePiece tokenizer
- **Multiple Languages**: English, Hindi, Konkani support
- **Data Pipeline**: Handles JSONL format corpus files
- **Vocabulary**: Uses your 32k/48k vocabulary

### ✅ Production Features
- **Mixed Precision**: FP16 training for speed
- **Gradient Accumulation**: Effective large batch sizes
- **Learning Rate Scheduling**: Cosine decay with warmup
- **Logging**: Comprehensive training metrics
- **Error Handling**: Robust error recovery

## 🎯 What This Solves

### ❌ Before (Problems):
- Official Gemma repo has no training scripts
- Complex setup for custom tokenizers
- Memory management issues on Kaggle
- No checkpoint management for long training
- Difficult to handle large corpus data

### ✅ After (Solutions):
- **Complete Training System**: Ready-to-use scripts
- **Seamless Integration**: Your tokenizer works out-of-the-box
- **Smart Memory**: Auto-optimization for Kaggle GPUs
- **Robust Checkpointing**: Never lose training progress
- **Efficient Data Loading**: Handles 20GB+ corpus smoothly

## 🚀 How to Use (Super Simple)

### Step 1: Upload to Kaggle (5 minutes)
1. Create Kaggle datasets for your tokenizer and corpus
2. Create new GPU notebook
3. Upload these training files

### Step 2: Run Setup (2 minutes)
```bash
!bash setup_kaggle.sh
!python test_setup.py
```

### Step 3: Start Training (1 command)
```bash
!python train_gemma3_kaggle.py --model_size 1b --max_steps 10000
```

That's it! Your model will train for 8-12 hours and save checkpoints automatically.

## 📊 Expected Results

### Training Performance
- **Model**: Gemma 3 1B parameters
- **Training Time**: 8-12 hours on Kaggle GPU
- **Memory Usage**: ~14-15GB (auto-optimized)
- **Throughput**: ~100-200 tokens/second
- **Checkpoints**: Every 1,000 steps (customizable)
